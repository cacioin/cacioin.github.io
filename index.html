                         <h2>The invisible life of Addie LaRue</h2>
                         <h3>Written by V.E. Schwab</h3>
                    </header>
                    <main>
                        <p>I will start by saying this will 100% include spoilers so if you are not a fan of that you shall scroll away! This is a mediocre attempt at talking about the parts that took a reaction out of me so it might not make any sense without context! Lets begin now!</p>
                        <p>Honestly the most memorable things about this book is how the author created such a complex character as well as the description of the places that Addie visited in this book. Addie is portrayed as all the experiences that she has been through, that she has learnt from and is still standing and going strong at the end (with a little more determination might I add).One of my favourite parts about this book is when Addie’s father taught her about creating art. He gave her a way to dream in the little village she was growing up in and I guess you could say in the end that was her demise because it made her want so much more than the simple village life she had ahead of her. This part as well as him telling Addie stories moved something inside me; it was just so precious how the author wrote their whole interaction.</p>
                        <p>As we go further into the book, she “makes a deal with the devil”, and you can see it’s in quote marks because technically the person she made a deal with was actually a dark God. Anyway she kept trying to find a name for this God and in the end it finally came to her and it’s “Lucifer”… MY FACE DROPPED!!! Like of course it’s him, but at the same time why did it take me so long to figure it out. ALSO when the author describes how he actually is like instead of the body he takes form of for Addie, it’s so scary, the darkness that is described like a living thing… shudders. 

                            One part that bothered me quite a bit is when Henry found out how she manages to get by day to day. Like OBVIOUSLY she has to steal, that’s literally the only way for her to eat or get new clothes. And it bothered me so much because WHY are you so judgemental? She literally has no choice and yet you are condemning her for it. What an ass. Anyway now onto the ending and my opinions on it —> WHAT WAS THAT, honestly at the beginning I did expect for her to end up with Luc as a lover but then it kind of went away due to meeting Henry and things going so well but of course that doesn’t last. She ends up saving Henry from his deal by giving herself to Luc and like why so predictable but at the same time I don’t know… I did enjoy that in the end she was determined to make Luc suffer for all of eternity.</p>
                            <p>All in all this book gets a 4/5 from me. It’s a good read and I couldn’t put it down at times. The descriptions of the characters as well as the places visited in the book are very nice, and the references to artists from real life that seemed like they sold their souls were really well placed. Hope you enjoyed my rant!</p>
